# Week 7 Mechanical - NAME: ___________  `__/6`


## JavaScript

```js
var color = 'blue';
var colors = {red: 'red', white: 'white'};
```

##### Q1) Write a single line of code that uses ONLY the `color` variable AND square bracket notation and will result in the `colors` object being `{"red": "red", "white": "white", "blue": "blue"}`
<br><br>

##### Q2) Write an arrow function named `sum` that accepts two arguments and returns the sum of those two arguments
<br><br> 


```js
let grades = ['C', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F', 'A'];
```
#### Assuming the above `grades` array:

##### Q3) Write the code that assigns to a variable named `output` a single string that looks like `C | A | A | B | C | D | F | A`<br>_(note that there is a space on both sides of the_ `|` _character)_
<br><br>

##### Q4) Write the code that computes the number of "A" grades and assigns it to a variable named `count` (bravo if you can do it in one line)
<br><br><br>

## Node

```js
// cars.js

var cars = [
	{make: 'Toyota', model: 'Camry', year: 2015},
	{make: 'Honda', model: 'Accord', year: 2016},
	{make: 'Ford', model: 'Focus', year: 2017}
];

module.exports = cars;
```

##### Q5) Assuming the above Node module, write A SINGLE LINE of code that requires the `cars.js` module and assigns how many objects there are in the `cars` array to a variable named `numCars`:
<br><br><br><br>


```js
var result = require('./math').multiply(5, 6);
```

##### Q6) Write a Node module below such that the value of variable `result` above would be equal to `30`:
<br><br><br><br>
