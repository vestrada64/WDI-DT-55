# Project 2<br>RoR Full-stack CRUD Application

### Overview

This second project is your first foray into **building a full-stack 
application.** You'll be **building a Rails app** from the 
ground up yourself.

**This is exciting!** It's a lot, but by the end of the week we will 
have given you the all of the tools needed to build your app.  Here's 
the best part - you get to decide what you want to build - as long as it meets the technical requirements outlined below.

**You will be working individually for this project.** You'll be 
designing and coding the app yourself.

**If in doubt, discuss your app idea with an instructor to get their feedback before you dive too deep into user stories and wireframes!**

---

### Key Due Dates

- **Thursday morning**: Share your project's:
	- Wireframes
	- User Stories
	- ERD

- **Next Friday**:  Demo your app!

---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

- **Have at _least_ 2 models**.  One model representing someone using your application, and one more that represents the main functional idea for your app. Adding at least one additional model that relates to your app's main model is encouraged.
- **Include sign up/log in functionality**, with authentication implemented by `has_secure_password`. Implement basic authorization by 
  restricting access to certain features, such as editing and deleting a
  resource, to an authenticated user, or the user that created that resource.
- Have **complete CRUD data operations** for at least one of your resources.
- Be styled with well-organized and DRY **CSS** (or SCSS).
- Be **deployed online** (Heroku).

---

### Necessary Deliverables

- A **working full-stack application, built by you**, hosted on Heroku.
- A **git repository hosted on Github** for your app with frequent 
  commits dating back to the **very beginning** of your project. **Commit early, commit often**!
- A **`README.md` file** that includes:
	 - A intro/description of the app.
	 - Screenshot(s)
    - Explanations of the technologies used.
    - Getting Started section with:
    	- Link to your deployed app
    	- Link to your Trello board
    - Unsolved problems (if any)
    - Future (Ice Box) Features
- A **Trello board** with:
    - **User Stories**, each moving from left to right in the following 
      three lists in your board:
      	- Ice Box
      	- Current/MVP
      	- Completed.
      Prioritize your user stories within the Ice Box with your "wish 
      list" stories at the bottom.
    - **Wireframes of your UI**.
    - An **ERD** showing the attributes of each model and the associations between them.
- **User Stories** must follow the following template:<br>**_As a \<user role\>, I want \<feature\>, because \<reason\>._**<br>The _reason_ is optional if it's blatantly obvious.

---

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- **Plan with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning 
  with Wireframes, an ERD & User Stories, so you don't waste time building 
  things you don't need.
- **Remember to keep things small and focus on the MVP** â€“ feature creep can doom a project!
- **Implement the model representing the "user" and authentication first** because typically your other model(s) will relate to the logged in user.
- **Test your models, especially their relationships**, in the Rails console.
- **Seed data** to assist in the development process.

### Project Idea Guidance

Nearly all of the web applications you interact with on a daily basis
would do for this project as most are "full-stack" CRUD apps.

#### Do Not Do

Non-CRUD applications such as:

- Games
- Portfolio, or presentational pages
- Marketing or content oriented websites

#### Good Examples

So much of the Internet is CRUD apps!

- Social media:
  - Twitter
  - Instagram
  - Reddit
- Marketplaces: 
  - Craigslist
  - Etsy
- Organizational, Business or ERP apps:
  - Salesforce
  - Payroll app
  - Accounting app

**Do you have a personal interest that could be a CRUD app?**

Another piece of advice:  If you choose to develop an app that has the concept of a shopping cart (storefront), do not attempt to implement the actual payment functionality.

---

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

- Your instructors will be evaluating your project during your demonstration as well as reviewing the code in your repo.
- If there are deficiencies in meeting the requirements, you will be given guidance on what needs to be done to meet the requirements.  Your updated project will be due the Monday following demo Friday.
- If there is a specific section of code that you would like feedback by an instructor on, please ask.
- After demos, a peer code review checklist will be completed by all students.
- Use of the code review form as guidance during development of your app is recommended.
